		<!-- Poster -->
			<p><strong class="m-first-word">Culture Food Wars</strong> was an idea that stemmed from my childhood that introduced the various cultures of the world and to experience through their individual and unique cuisine. After creating the poster in Adobe Illustrator, the layers were ported into Adobe After Effects in order to make the animated version. Besides demonstrating creative, it took great advantage of the abilities that Adobe has to offer designers.</p>

Color theory was also needed to show unity and a calm approach to suggesting an alternative way to progressive living. </p>
